            Mr. Chiduku is an accomplished Risk Management professional with over 15 years of extensive experience in auditing, accounting, and enterprise risk management across both public and private sector institutions in Zimbabwe.
        
            He holds a Master of Science in Strategic Management (MSCSM) from Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) and a Bachelor of Commerce in Accountancy from Zimbabwe Open University. He is also a certified Data Protection Officer, reflecting his commitment to upholding data privacy and compliance in today’s digital landscape.
        
            Currently serving as the Risk Management Manager at Chinhoyi University of Technology, Mr. Chiduku plays a pivotal role in embedding sound risk management practices across the University and its Strategic Business Units, which include three hotels, CUT Platz, and a commercial farm. <br><br> His role followed the strategic demerger of the Audit and Risk Management Department — a move aligned with global best practices in corporate governance.
        
            Before joining CUT in 2020, Mr. Chiduku was the Principal Auditor for Mashonaland West Province under the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, overseeing internal audit functions for over eight years. His professional journey also spans roles in various financial institutions, sharpening his expertise in financial controls, compliance, and governance.
        
            Beyond his professional duties, Mr. Chiduku is passionate about community development. He has served as Honorary Finance Director for Chaedza Progressive College since 2012 and Sinoia Primary School since 2022, providing oversight on financial policy implementation and strategic financial management.
        
            Mr. Chiduku remains dedicated to serving with humility, integrity, and professionalism in the execution of his responsibilities.
